# Angular Material Admin Amplify

This is a fork of [changhuixu/angular-material-admin](https://github.com/changhuixu/angular-material-admin) to demonstrate how to set up Authenticator with custom route guards. 

This is **not** an official AWS guide. Instead it is just a sample app created by individual @wlee221 to help GitHub issue [#2314](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/issues/2314).
